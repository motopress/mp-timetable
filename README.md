## Getting Started
The plugin has two pairs of build scripts. The first pair is for generating files for editor blocks. The second pair is responsible for compiling styles from .less to .css. 

To compile files for editor blocks you need:
* Run `npm run dev` to compile your files automatically whenever you've made changes to the associated files.
* Run `npm run build` to compile files for release.

To compile styles you need:
* Run `npm run dev:styles` to compile your styles automatically whenever you've made changes to the associated files.
* Run `npm run build:styles` to compile styles once.
